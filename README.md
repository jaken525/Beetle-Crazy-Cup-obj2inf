# obj2inf
This program is designed to convert obj files of 3d models into 4 files: inf, nor (not always), tri and ver. These files were used by Xpiral for games such as Beetle Crazy Cup (Beetle Buggin', Käfer Total), Radiсal Drive and Larry Ragland 4x4 Challenge.

# objparser
The repository was used for objparser: https://github.com/stefangordon/ObjParser

# Instruction
The number of polygons must be no more than 2000. You won't be able to load the resulting model with a large number of polygons into the game!

The UV scan must be reflected vertically.

The approximate dimensions and directions of the model can be taken from the original model "1_CARRO.obj".

The model must be made of triangles.

1. Drag the model file to the program folder.
2. Open "objparser.exe".
3. Choose the model file.
4. Enter the number of the texture that will replace the original one.
